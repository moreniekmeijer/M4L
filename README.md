# M4L Melodic Pattern Generator

This is a Max for Live device (.amxd) which takes creates semi-random (controllable) midi patterns of different scales and rhythms. Download the .amxd file for Ableton. I included a maxpat as well.

This device is work in progress. Let me know if stuff is not working! I really want to know this, also for my own learning curve. Have fun making music!
